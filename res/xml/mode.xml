    If your application has only one mode and the required "<uses-feature>" capabilites are
    specified in AndroidManifest.xml, you do not need to add the same capabilites here.

    "android.hardware.camera" is added below as an example of how you can add "<uses-feature>"
    tags in this file, however for this specific code example it is not actually necessary but left in
    to illustrate what is possible.
